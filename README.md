# HackerRank_Solutions

Welcome to **HackerRank_Solutions**—a curated collection of my solutions to various HackerRank challenges implemented in Python. This repository showcases my journey from initial approaches to more optimized, Pythonic solutions.

## Repository Structure

Each challenge is organized into its own directory. For example, a typical folder structure looks like this:

```
HackerRank_Solutions/
│── PythonSolutions/
│   |── DefaultDict_Tutorial
|   |   ├──solution1.py # Initial solution (less optimized)
|   |   ├──solution2.py # Optimized, Pythonic solution
│
├──.gitignore
│
└── README.md # Detailed explanation of approaches and learnings
```

## What You'll Find

- **Multiple Problem Folders:**  
  Each folder contains:
  - **Problem Statement & Sample I/O:** A clear description of the challenge.
  - **Solution Versions:**  
    - *Solution 1*: My initial, straightforward solution.
    - *Solution 2*: A refined version that uses best practices and Pythonic techniques.
  - **Documentation:**  
    - A README file outlining the approach.
    - Key learnings and insights into various Python concepts (e.g., `defaultdict`, list slicing, `enumerate`, input handling, print unpacking, etc.)

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning progress as I solve HackerRank problems. It serves as both a personal reference and a resource for others who are looking to improve their coding skills and learn best practices in Python.

## How to Use

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gnanas1295/HackerRank_Solutions.git
   ```

2. Navigate to a Challenge Folder:

   ```sh
   cd HackerRank_Solutions/PythonSolutions/DefaultDict_Tutorial
   ```
3. Explore the Code:

   - Review ```solution1.py``` for the initial implementation.
   - Check out ```solution2.py``` for the optimized version.
   - Read the ```README``` in each folder for detailed explanations and learnings.

4. Run a Solution
   - Use Python to execute the code
   ```sh
   python solution2.py
   ```
