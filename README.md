# HackerRank_Solutions

Welcome to **HackerRank_Solutions**—a curated collection of my solutions to various HackerRank challenges implemented in Python. This repository showcases my journey from initial approaches to more optimized, Pythonic solutions.

## Repository Structure

Each challenge is organized into its own directory. For example, a typical folder structure looks like this:

HackerRank_Solutions/ └── PythonSolutions/ └── DefaultDict_Tutorial/ ├── solution1.py # Initial solution (less optimized) ├── solution2.py # Optimized, Pythonic solution └── README.md # Detailed explanation of approaches and learnings



## What You'll Find

- **Multiple Problem Folders:**  
  Each folder contains:
  - **Problem Statement & Sample I/O:** A clear description of the challenge.
  - **Solution Versions:**  
    - *Solution 1*: My initial, straightforward solution.
    - *Solution 2*: A refined version that uses best practices and Pythonic techniques.
  - **Documentation:**  
    - A README file outlining the approach.
    - Key learnings and insights into various Python concepts (e.g., `defaultdict`, list slicing, `enumerate`, input handling, print unpacking, etc.).

- **Key Python Concepts Covered:**
  - **Input Handling:** Using `sys.stdin.read()` and `.split()` for efficient input processing.
  - **Data Structures:**  
    - Using lists and slicing for data manipulation.
    - Leveraging `defaultdict` from the `collections` module to simplify dictionary usage.
  - **Control Structures:**  
    - Utilizing loops and conditional checks.
    - Applying the `enumerate()` function (with `start=1`) to maintain 1-indexed positions.
  - **Output Formatting:**  
    - Using Python's unpacking operator (`*`) with `print()` for clean, space-separated output.
    - Understanding string conversion and formatting functions.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to document my learning progress as I solve HackerRank problems. It serves as both a personal reference and a resource for others who are looking to improve their coding skills and learn best practices in Python.
